'''
$ cd ~
$ cd desktop
'''
* Once in the desktop directory, clone this repository by entering: `$ git clone https://github.com/droycho/questions.git` 
* It should create a directory in you desktop called "questions". Navigate to this directory with: `$ cd questions`.
* Once inside the questions directory, run the following command to install necessary packages and serve web app: `$ npm install && bower install && ember s`
* open you web browser and type `localhost:4200` in the address bar to get to the site.
* Experiment with the site, please let me know of any bugs, issues, or suggestions you may have for improvement.
